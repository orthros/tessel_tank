Use Tessel 2 to controller 2 DC motors.

### Issues with websockets
We ran in to a bunch of compatibity issues with version of node, websockets and t2 firmware & cli.
In the end we were able to get a few dozen people up and running by matching all these versions.

Tessel Environment Versions:
- 2-cli: 0.1.4
- t2-firmware: 0.0.16
- Node.js: 4.5.0
